SQL Adventure work

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language for accessing and manipulating Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs).
Data manipulation is the process of organizing or arranging data in order to make it easier to interpret. 
SQL is widely used in popular RDBMSs such as SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL.
The smallest unit of execution in SQL is a query. A SQL query is used to select, update, and delete data.
In RDBMSs, all the data is stored in tables, with each table consisting of rows and columns.
Data integrity in SQL databases refers to ensuring that each row of a table is uniquely identified so that data can be retrieved separately.
